Welcome to VexU! Congratulations for figuring out how to clone the repo :) 

Here are some more git instructions for you guys to keep in mind:
git branch
git checkout
git checkout -b
git add [-u]
git commit [-m]
git remote -v
git push origin <branchName>
git log

The first assignment for you is a calculator program in c++
I would like you to implmement the following functions:
add()
subtract()
multiply()
divide()
square()
sqrt()

Don't forget the main function! 

User interface is allowed to be stdin/stdout, as long as you are comfortable with the synax.

When you are finished, push to a new branch and modify the README to include your name and berkeley email address.

Happy coding!

Eric
