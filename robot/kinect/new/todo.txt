Key detection with cv is very slow:
- Replace with key listener (using 'keyboard' python library)

Bottleneck is in camera I/O
- Optimize by threading and storing queue of images

Rest of program runs very fast including contour detection. Don't need to optimize further.

Minor speedup:
- For find contour, use: cv.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE

Vary hsv values to test best detection
Target detection (test methods, i.e. max area)
